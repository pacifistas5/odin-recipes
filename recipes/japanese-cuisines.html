      <h1>Chicken Katsu</h1>
        <p>With a light, crispy exterior and moist interior, Japanese katsu is comfort food at its best. Most often made with pork, it’s great with chicken, too. The panko-coated fried cutlets are typically accompanied by finely sliced cabbage and tangy, sweet and salty katsu sauce. However, they are also served over rice (katsu don), with curry (katsu curry), and in a sandwich (katsu sando). For the crunchiest katsu, don’t be tempted to substitute regular breadcrumbs for the classic panko. And make sure to maintain the oil temperature as the cutlets cook.</p>

        <h2><em>Ingredients:</h2></em>
            <ul>
                <li>1/2 cup ketchup</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce</li>
                <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>2 large eggs, lightly beaten</li>
                <li>1 1/2 cups panko</li>   
                <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
                <li>2 boneless skinless chicken breasts, butterflied and cut into 4 cutlets</li>
                <li>1 1/2 cups vegetable or canola oil</li>
                <li>2 cups finely sliced cabbage</li>
                <li>Cooked white rice, for serving</li>
                <li>4 lemon wedges</li>

            </ul>

        <h2><em>Direction:</h2></em>
            <ol>
                <li>For the katsu sauce: Stir together the ketchup, Worcestershire and soy sauce in a small bowl. Set aside.</li>
                <li>For the chicken: Set a wire rack in a baking sheet or line a large plate with a paper towel and set aside. Place the flour, eggs and panko into 3 separate large shallow bowls. Stir together 1 teaspoon salt and 1 teaspoon pepper in a small bowl and then sprinkle the mixture on both sides of the cutlets. Working with 1 cutlet at a time, dredge it in the flour, dip it into the eggs, and then coat it with the panko, gently pressing both sides into the panko to make sure it adheres well. Transfer the cutlet to a plate and repeat with the remaining cutlets. </li>
                <li>Heat the oil in a large skillet over high heat until it reaches about 350 degrees F on a deep-fry thermometer. (To test for readiness, sprinkle a few pieces of panko into the oil. It should bubble vigorously.) </li>
                <li>Working with 2 cutlets at a time to prevent crowding, cook the chicken until golden brown on both sides, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer to the prepared wire rack or plate, season with salt and let rest for 2 minutes. Meanwhile, repeat with the remaining 2 cutlets. (See Cook’s Note.) </li>
                <li>Slice each cutlet crosswise into 1/2-inch strips, lay on a bed of sliced cabbage and serve with the katsu sauce, rice and a lemon wedge.  </li>
            </ol>   

        <h3>Cook’s Note</h3>
            <p>These cutlets are great for freezing for make-ahead meals: Cook the cutlets, but don’t slice them. Let cool completely and then freeze in a plastic bag, placing parchment paper between the pieces to prevent sticking. They will keep for up to 3 months. To reheat, place on a baking sheet in a 350 degree F oven until heated through and crispy, about 15 minutes. Slice before serving.</p>
